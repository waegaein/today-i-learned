# The Total Cost of Owning a Mess

*   As the mess build, the productivity of the team continues to decrease.
*   As productivity decreases, management does the only thing they can; they add more staff to the project in hopes of increasing productivity.
*   But that new staff is not versed in the design of the system.
*   Furthermore, they, and everyone else on the team, are under horrific pressure to increase productivity.
*   So they all make more and more messes, driving the productivity ever further toward zero.
