# Principle of Least Privileges

*   Every program and user of the system should operate using the lest set of privileges necessary to complete the job.
*   Unintentional, unwanted, or improper uses of privileges are less likely to occur.
*   It limits the damage from error, accident, or break-in.

E.g.
*   User's home directory
    *   drwx------.
    *   Only owner can access.
*   Sharing documents with read-only permission
    *   -rw-r--r--.
    *   Only owner can write.
*   Append-only permission for log file
    *   drwxr-sr-x+
    *   Logs cannot be overwritten.
    *   Plus means extended access control like append-only.
