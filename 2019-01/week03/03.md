# Certificate Signing and Installation

1.  Service provider requests server certificate to certificate authority (e.g. Symantec) for signing.
2.  Certificate authority hashes the certificate content to generate message digest. (e.g. SHA-256)
3.  Certificate authority encrypts the digest using its private key to generate signature.
4.  Certificate authority append the signature along with certificate content to form a digital certificate.
5.  Certificate authority sends the digital certificate back to the service provider.
6.  Service provider installs the digital certificate on its web servers.
