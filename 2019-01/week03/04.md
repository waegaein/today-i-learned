2.  Browser extracts signature from the digital certificate.
3.  Browser retrieves public key of certificate authority based on issue field in certificate.
4.  Browser decrypts the signature to restore the message digest.
5.  Meanwhile, the browser hashes certificate content to generate a message digest.
