# Security Principles
A collection of desirable system property behaviors, designs and implementation practice that can reduce the risk. They reduce either the likelihood of the harm occurrence or their impact. We can be aware of the threat to our system and ultimately derive a set of protection requirements.

# Defense in Depth
Layers of security mechanisms increase the security of the system as a whole. If an attack causes one security mechanism to fail, other mechanisms may still provide the necessary security to protect the system.

*   For network and infrastructure attacks
    *   Protect the local area network
    *   Protect the wide area network
    *   Deploy firewall
    *   Deploy intrusion detection system
*   For insider attacks
    *   Deploy physical and personal security
    *   Deploy authenticated access control and auditing procedure
