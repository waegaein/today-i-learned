# CH3 Functions

## Functions should not
*   expose switch statements, which do multiple things inherently, to the high level.
*   pass Boolean flag argument as it forces more than one behavior.
*   transform input argument instead of using return value.
*   have side effects that are not implied by names.
*   perform command and query at the same time.
*   perform action and error handling at the same time.
*   have multiple entries or exits.
