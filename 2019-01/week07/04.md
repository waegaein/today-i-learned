# 2. Defense with Diversity

*   Mono instruction architecture such as Intel 386 or 64 architecture used by current computer systems make it easier for attackers to develop just one malicious software and then attack vulnerabilities existing in all the system using the same ISA architectures.
*   We should encourage the development of diversity in
    *   System architectures
    *   Operating systems
    *   Library / Packages
    *   Programming languages / Frameworks
*   We should produce framework that allow real-time seamless service/application migration from one system which fails (or about to fail) to the others.
